## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning

I actively work with machine learning, focusing on both classic and deep learning approaches:

* ðŸ“Š **Data preprocessing** and feature engineering (Pandas, polars, PySpark)
* ðŸ§  **Deep learning projects** (Computer Vision, NLP)
* ðŸŽ¯ **Model training and evaluation** (PyTorch, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost)
* ðŸ§ª Applied ML in **crypto-related** tasks
         
## ðŸ¥· Sensei 

It's my Python framework that provides a quick way to build robust HTTP requests. Use type hints, to build requests, with 
little or no implementation.
